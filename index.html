        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>I am very passionate about technology, especially software. The first ten years of my career I
          worked as a software developer. Our family then moved to a rural town in the Western Cape. I joined a local
          primary school to assist with their IT needs. The lockdown periode strengthed the desire to pick up
          coding again. During this period I developed a website for our church using Joomla and this in turn
          sparked a new interest in Web Development. My dream is to work as a Web Developer and use the IT
          experience that I have gained over the past 20 years.</p>
